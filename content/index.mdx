## Why I Looked Beyond Traditional Auth Solutions

Authentication in Next.js often starts simple but becomes messy quickly.

I’ve used:

- Custom JWT implementations
- NextAuth / Auth.js
- Cookie-based sessions

Each works — but they come with **boilerplate, edge cases, or hidden complexity**.

While working on a personal project, I discovered **Better Auth**, which focuses on:

- Explicit APIs
- Server-first session handling
- Clean separation of concerns

This post documents **how I integrated Better Auth**, the mistakes I made, and what finally worked.

## What is Better Auth (Quick Overview)

Better Auth is an authentication framework that:

- Emphasizes **server-side session access**
- Avoids magic abstractions
- Works cleanly with **Next.js App Router**

The biggest mindset shift for me was:

> _“Stop trying to read sessions like NextAuth — ask the auth API directly.”_
