# Better Auth: A Modern Authentication Framework for TypeScript

Authentication is one of those features that every application needs, but implementing it correctly can be surprisingly complex. From password hashing to session management, OAuth flows to two-factor authentication, there's a lot to get right. That's where Better Auth comes in.

## What is Better Auth?

Better Auth is a modern, type-safe authentication framework built specifically for TypeScript applications. It aims to provide a comprehensive authentication solution that's both developer-friendly and secure by default. Unlike many authentication libraries that force you into specific patterns, Better Auth is designed to be flexible while maintaining strong security practices.

## Why Another Auth Library?

You might be wondering: don't we already have Passport, Auth.js (NextAuth), and dozens of other authentication solutions? What makes Better Auth different?

The key differentiators are:

**Type Safety First**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript, Better Auth provides excellent type inference and catches errors at compile time rather than runtime.

**Modern Architecture**: Designed for modern frameworks like Next.js, SvelteKit, and Remix, with full support for both server and client components.

**Batteries Included**: Comes with built-in support for multiple authentication strategies, session management, password reset flows, email verification, and more.

**Database Agnostic**: Works with any database through adapters, whether you're using PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or even Prisma ORM.

## Core Features

### Multiple Authentication Strategies

Better Auth supports various authentication methods out of the box:

```typescript
import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth";

const auth = new BetterAuth({
  database: {
    provider: "postgresql",
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
    github: {
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
  },
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
    requireEmailVerification: true,
  },
});
```

### Session Management

Better Auth handles session management intelligently, with support for both cookie-based and token-based sessions:

```typescript
// Server-side session checking
const session = await auth.getSession(request);

if (!session) {
  return redirect("/login");
}

// Access user data with full type safety
const userId = session.user.id;
const userEmail = session.user.email;
```

### Email Verification and Password Reset

Common authentication flows are built-in and customizable:

```typescript
// Send verification email
await auth.sendVerificationEmail({
  email: "user@example.com",
  redirectTo: "/verify-email",
});

// Initiate password reset
await auth.sendPasswordResetEmail({
  email: "user@example.com",
  redirectTo: "/reset-password",
});
```

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example of integrating Better Auth into a Next.js application:

### Installation

```bash
npm install better-auth
# or
pnpm add better-auth
```

### Basic Setup

```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = new BetterAuth({
  database: {
    provider: "postgresql",
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
  callbacks: {
    async session({ session, user }) {
      return {
        ...session,
        user: {
          ...session.user,
          role: user.role,
        },
      };
    },
  },
});
```

### Creating Auth Routes

```typescript
// app/api/auth/[...auth]/route.ts
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

export const GET = auth.handler;
export const POST = auth.handler;
```

### Client-Side Usage

```typescript
"use client";

import { useAuth } from "better-auth/react";

export function LoginForm() {
  const { signIn, isLoading } = useAuth();

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await signIn.email({
      email: "user@example.com",
      password: "password123",
      redirectTo: "/dashboard",
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Two-Factor Authentication

Better Auth includes built-in support for 2FA:

```typescript
// Enable 2FA for a user
await auth.twoFactor.enable({
  userId: user.id,
  method: "totp",
});
